To accomplish this work, it was necessary to define a development life-cycle to evaluate the selected works. Thus, it was used the concepts of \cite{papazoglou2006service} which attempt to compare a complete life cycle and its use in the most prominent development methods that claim to be agile. In this context, the development life-cycle phases are project inception, requirements specification, design, coding, unit test, integration test, system test, acceptance test, and maintenance. For the purposes of this paper, only the middle bar in Figure \todo{put figure} is important. The middle bar refers to the software development life-cycle analysis, where the gray bar indicates that the phase is supported by the agile method and the white bar indicates that the phase is not supported.
